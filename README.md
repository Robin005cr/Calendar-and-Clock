# Calendar-and-Clock
In our day to day life we encounter many logical problems related to time. This project aims at bringing all those problems under one application.

## ⏰ Digital Clock
A. Normal time  
B. Railway time  
C. Railway time converter

## ⏲️ Timer
A. Infinite timer  
B. Stop watch  
C. Count down timer

## Alarm

## 📅 General Calendar
A. Calendar of year  
B. Calendar of a particular month  
C. Day finder from date

## 🔐 Calendar login
A. Meeting scheduler  
B. Blocking for leaves and events  
C. Task reminder

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- Interrupt driven method is not added in the program, since you can use it according to your project.
- Eg. If the timer starts, the program will wait until it finishes.
- The reason why its not added is that key board interrupt is different according to the OS.
- The unit test files are not added because in Visual Studio it is added as a new project. Adding the files is making more confusion. Will add all the unit test files under the test folder in future.
